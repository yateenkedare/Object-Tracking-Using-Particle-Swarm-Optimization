# Object-Tracking-Using-Particle-Swarm-Optimization

In order to robustly track any random object we <br />
usually require lots of processing power. Tracking objects <br />
from our day to day computational devices may introduce a <br />
lag in the tracking system. In order to speed up the process we <br />
are using Particle swarm optimization for tracking. This <br />
method allows us to track objects with minimal hardware <br />
requirements. Output from Particle Swarm Optimization <br />
usually contains little noise. In order to eliminate this noise <br />
and estimation the trajectory of the object we use Kalman 
filter.
